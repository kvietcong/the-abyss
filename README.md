# The Abyss
A low-profile diode-less 37-key keyboard with nice!view support. Designed with Ergogen and Kicad.

Named after where too much of my time and money went, *The Abyss*.

## Pictures

## Info
> The following is just a long-winded description and commentary of how I designed the board, ordered parts, and assembled it.

## "Review"
> The following is just me rambling about the keyboard and ways I'd might change it in another design.

## Things to do
- Design a carrying case for it.
    - Maybe design a bottom case for it.
- Make a video about it.
- Finish up this README.
